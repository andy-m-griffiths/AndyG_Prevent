# Prevent

This Prevent website is designed to be a simple introduction to the UK Government's Prevent
strategy. It was designed to be of assistance to any small charitable organisation so that
people running group discussions are aware of possible signs of radicalisation, even though it is
not a legal requirement for them to act upon them.
Note: This website was developed as part of a "boot camp" learning project, and one of the learning
objectives was to use AI in it's design / creation.
