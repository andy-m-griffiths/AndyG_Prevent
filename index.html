                        <h2 class="text-center mt-3 kodchasan-regular">What Prevent is</h2>
                        <p class="text-center kodchasan-regular small">The aim of Prevent is to stop people 
                            from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. Prevent sits alongside
                            long-established safeguarding duties and is part of the Counter-Terrorism 
                            and Security Act (2015). The Prevent duty is designed to help ensure that 
                            people who are susceptible to radicalisation are as supported as they 
                            would be under safeguarding processes. It means that specified authorities 
                            such as education, health, local authorities, police and criminal justice 
                            agencies (prisons, probation and youth justice) have a duty to help stop 
                            people being radicalised into terrorism.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-center kodchasan-regular">Myths</h3>
                        <p class="text-center kodchasan-semibold small">Myth: Prevent targets specific 
                            faiths or ethnic groups</p>
                        <p class="text-center kodchasan-regular small">Prevent does not target a specific 
                            faith or ethnic group. It addresses the ideological causes of terrorism 
                            and deals with all kinds of terrorist threats to the UK.</p>
                        <p class="text-center kodchasan-regular small">There is a focus on Islamist and extreme 
                            right-wing ideologies and the people and behaviours associated with them, as 
                            they represent the greatest threat to the UK. Other ideologies are less 
                            present, but still have the potential to be used to justify terrorism.</p>
                        <p class="text-center kodchasan-regular small">Prevent is mainly delivered at the 
                            community level through the local authority and partners in education and 
                            healthcare. This ensures that radicalisation risks are properly understood 
                            within the local context.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-center kodchasan-regular">Susceptibility</h3>
                        <p class="text-center kodchasan-regular small">Susceptibility is complex and unique to a person's 
                            circumstances<br> Not all people susceptible to radicalisation will be a vulnerable person.
                            <br> A person can be vulnerable if they need special care, support, or protection because of 
                            age, disability, risk of abuse, or neglect.<br> Susceptibility can be closely connected to 
                            emotions.​​​​​<br> People may feel insignificant, marginalised or invisible.<br> A person's 
                            susceptibility to radicalisation may be linked to their vulnerability<br> However, 
                            vulnerabilities may not be present or may not be relevant.

                        <p class="text-center kodchasan-regular small">Terrorism begins with radicalisation.<br> It's 
                            the name given to the process that moves a person to legitimise their support of violence.
                            <br> Radicalisation feeds on emotions.<br> The emotions involved when someone is at risk of 
                            becoming a terrorist or supporting terrorism are common to all of us.<br> <strong>Context 
                            is key</strong><br> When spotting signs of radicalisation you need to understand the 
                            full context of the situation.

                    <h3 class="text-center kodchasan-regular">Foundation</h3>
                    <p class="text-center kodchasan-regular small">A terrorist attack is like the tip of an iceberg; 
                        the part above the surface that we see. But just like that tip, it's supported by a greater 
                        mass below the surface: Hidden activity that builds and builds, leading up to physical 
                        violence.<br> This activity might include criminal acts like finding somewhere to target; 
                        getting weapons; raising funds.<br> Anyone can be attracted to a terrorist cause. And, like 
                        an iceberg, right down the bottom, in the dark waters, is where most terrorism begins.<br> 
                        Terrorism starts with a vulnerable person becoming attracted to individuals, groups, or c
                        auses. New ways of thinking, driven by those who want to exploit that person's trust; who 
                        focus in on that person's grievances or desires and say they have an apparent means to 
                        address it.<br> They promote ideologies that go against our shared values; that encourage 
                        intolerance and even glorify acts of violence.<br> These ideologies might claim political 
                        views or distort religion to draw vulnerable people in. But however it’s presented, the 
                        objective is the same: to incite someone to support terrorism, or perhaps become a 
                        terrorist themselves.<br> That might start with the lure of belonging. A promise of an 
                        increased status; the chance to impress their friends, or satisfy a need for excitement 
                        and purpose.<br> Because, often, those vulnerable to radicalisation feel disillusioned. 
                        Just like other young people, they are seeking answers, or that chance to re-invent or 
                        prove themselves.<br> And it's that willingness for change which means they rarely see 
                        the direction they are heading in which could result in them being charged with a 
                        terrorism-related offence.
